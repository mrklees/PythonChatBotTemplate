# Python Chatbot Template

This repository provides a template for creating goal-based chatbots for the Microsoft bot framework in python.  Simply clone the repository and then build out the actions and goals that you need for your bot! 

References:
This template currently uses this python library developed [by Grungnie available on GitHub](https://github.com/Grungnie/microsoftbotframework). It might be replaced by the official microsoft version once that is released.

We are also using the LUIS sdk from Microsoft.
